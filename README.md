# Multiple Instance Learning for Long Input NLP Models
This is implementation of classifier/model presented in thesis "Multiple Instance Learning for Long Input NLP Models" by Vojtech Jerabek, supervised by Ing. Jan Drchal Ph.D.


- Code is divided into two folder
    - Experiments with each experiment presented in thesis, each experiments has its own script_XX.sh, experiment_XX.py and model_XX.py file which are experiment specific. Script file executes the experiment defined in experiment file where it load model from model file.
    - Model folder presents developed model in general form, note that each application of this model might require case specific edits.
